## Current Status

We're currently debugging the user management flow. The Playwright test is failing with 500 Internal Server Error responses when attempting to create a user. The test successfully:
1. Navigates to the users page
2. Counts existing users
3. Navigates to the user creation form
4. Fills out the form

But it fails when:
1. Submitting the form (500 Internal Server Error)
2. Waiting for redirection back to the users page

## Remaining Tasks

### Fix User Creation Functionality
- [ ] Debug and fix the 500 Internal Server Error in the backend when creating users
- [ ] Ensure proper redirection after user creation in the frontend
- [ ] Complete the user management test flow

### User Management Flow
- [ ] Fix user creation API endpoint
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling in the frontend
- [ ] Verify user listing functionality works correctly
- [ ] Confirm user deletion works as expected

### Additional Testing
- [ ] Complete the user management test to verify:
  - [ ] Successful user creation
  - [ ] Updated user list after creation
  - [ ] Successful user deletion
  - [ ] Updated user list after deletion
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for task management

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with any changes
- [ ] Add setup instructions for running tests
- [ ] Document known issues and their workarounds

### Deployment
- [ ] Add deployment instructions for development and production
- [ ] Consider containerization with Docker

## Next Steps

1. Check the FastAPI server logs to identify the cause of the 500 Internal Server Error
2. Debug the user creation endpoint in the backend
3. Fix any issues in the frontend form submission
4. Update the Playwright test as needed
5. Complete the remaining test steps for user management flow
