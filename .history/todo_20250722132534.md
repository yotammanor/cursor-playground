## Completed Tasks

### Project Setup
- [x] Scaffolded project structure based on README.md specifications
- [x] Created common service with shared models, schemas, and utilities
- [x] Implemented FastAPI web-api service with user and task endpoints
- [x] Set up Celery worker service with task processing capabilities
- [x] Created React frontend with TypeScript and Vite

### Frontend Development
- [x] Migrated from Chakra UI to Shadcn UI and Tailwind CSS v4
- [x] Updated README.md to document UI framework decision
- [x] Implemented React components for layout, navigation, and pages
- [x] Created user and task management interfaces
- [x] Set up React Router for navigation
- [x] Configured React Query for API data fetching
- [x] Added proper TypeScript types for all components and API responses

### Backend Development
- [x] Implemented SQLAlchemy models for User and Task entities
- [x] Created Pydantic schemas for data validation
- [x] Set up FastAPI endpoints for CRUD operations
- [x] Configured CORS to allow frontend requests (updated to support port 5174)
- [x] Implemented database initialization and connection management
- [x] Added utility functions for password hashing and validation

### Testing
- [x] Set up Playwright for end-to-end testing
- [x] Created navigation and search test scripts
- [x] Implemented and fixed user management flow test
- [x] Verified user creation, viewing, and deletion functionality

### Version Control
- [x] Initialized Git repository
- [x] Created .gitignore file
- [x] Made initial commit with all project files
- [x] Created remote GitHub repository (yotammanor/cursor-playground)
- [x] Pushed code to GitHub

### Development Tools
- [ ] Create a VS Code launch.json file to start all services in debug mode

## Current Status

The application is now fully functional with the following features:
1. User management (create, read, update, delete)
2. Task management (create, read, update, delete)
3. Proper API integration between frontend and backend
4. End-to-end testing with Playwright

We have fixed the following issues:
1. CORS configuration to allow requests from port 5174 (the actual port used by the frontend)
2. User creation functionality in the frontend
3. User management test flow with proper selectors and assertions

## Remaining Tasks

### Development Tools
- [ ] Create a VS Code launch.json file to start all services in debug mode

### Additional Testing
- [ ] Add more comprehensive tests for task management
- [ ] Add unit tests for backend API endpoints
- [ ] Add unit tests for frontend components

### Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation with any changes
- [ ] Add setup instructions for running tests
- [ ] Document known issues and their workarounds

### Deployment
- [ ] Add deployment instructions for development and production
- [ ] Consider containerization with Docker

### Enhancements
- [ ] Add authentication and authorization
- [ ] Implement pagination for users and tasks lists
- [ ] Add sorting and filtering options
- [ ] Improve error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Add form validation with better user feedback

## Next Steps

1. Create a VS Code launch.json file to start all services in debug mode
2. Implement task management tests similar to user management tests
3. Add unit tests for backend API endpoints
4. Document the application setup and testing process
5. Consider deployment options and containerization
