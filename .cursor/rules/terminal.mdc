# Terminal Rules

- run project related commands using Taskfile.
- **NEVER run `task dev` or similar long-running server commands** - these start web servers that run indefinitely and require manual termination WITHOUT A PLAN ON HOW TO STOP.
- **If you MUST start a server for testing, use the built-in timeout tasks:**
  - `task dev:timeout` - starts all services with 5-second automatic timeout
  - `task app:dev:timeout` - starts frontend with 5-second timeout
  - `task api:dev:timeout` - starts API with 5-second timeout
  - `task worker:dev:timeout` - starts worker with 5-second timeout
  - **Custom timeout**: `task dev:timeout TIMEOUT=30` (30 seconds), `task dev:timeout TIMEOUT=300` (5 minutes)
    - These automatically stop servers after the specified timeout to prevent deadlocks
- **For behavior checking, use these alternatives instead:**
  - `task test` - run tests to verify functionality
  - `task lint` - check code quality and formatting
  - `task build` - verify build process works
  - `task doctor` - check system health and dependencies
  - Use specific test commands like `task app:test:unit` for frontend tests
- **Only start servers when explicitly needed for development work**, and always use `task doctor` first to check system health
