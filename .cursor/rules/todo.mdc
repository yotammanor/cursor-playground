- always work on a single todo at most.
- You are encouraged to break down a single todo item to multiple substeps.
- Never delete todo.md files without permissions
- todo files should not be committed or tracked, unless already tracked or requested by user.
- name should reflect task context. BAD - todo.md. GOOD - todo-add-user-login-flow.md
